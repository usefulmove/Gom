* Use buffer list ( :ls ) to identify what may be next to do. Use doing.org as well.
One org file for each project plus the main [[~/repos/doing/doing.org][doing.org]] program ( meta-project ) file.
Link to project files in doing.org program management file.

* A custom user keybinding layer has been constructed on `C-c`.
- examples . `C-c t` (terminal), `C-c e` (evaluate S-expression), `C-c o` (open link)

(global-set-key (kbd "C-c") nil)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c o") 'org-open-at-point)


* TODO
- consider different keybinding layer (currently C-c) (gum) (1)
